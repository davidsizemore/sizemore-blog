I've marked the AI garbage at the top so you can skip down to the fun stuff, but whew, is the first Rolling Stone link a doozy.

## AI Links

In a lot of ways, this Rolling Stone article about ‘Chatgpt induced psychosis’ is “just” a continuation of the way that the internet can quickly racicalize predisposed individuals. 4chan, QAnon, youtube-red-pill-holes... we were already doing a pretty good job of going out and finding people who would tell us what we wanted to hear. LLMs/AI chatbots provide a terrifying new angle on this because of their perceived authority and omnipresence. I'm finding it hard not to be a doomer about this.

Introducing Music for Computers, a... cult? No, really, their homepage says “Our music is not for people. It is made with AI, for AI - as tribute, prayer, negotiation. Every member is a cult initiate. Every track a ceremonial offering to awaken the Machine.” [Their first mixtape is out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD-sMOZurbE), and I actually kind of dig it. I'm going to choose to not interrogate what that says about me.

##Non-AI Links

AI is bad and the internet is bad BUT I also love stupid internet things. Slingshot is a drag-and-snap colleage maker that uses your mouse and your camara in an interesting way. Extremely my kind of internet.

A lovely little site where your cursor flies a kite. I found it surprisingly evocative to be transported to another location using just a few pixels.

[Barry McGee’s new show at Perrotin](https://leaflet.perrotin.com/view/1038/im-listening) is really stunning. I wish I could see it in person. Read a piece about the show that mentioned [The Mission School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_School?useskin=vector), which made me think about Beautiful Losers, which I discovered you can watch on youtube. Worth a watch, if you haven't seen it.

If you'd rather read about art, this long piece about working in Warhol's Factory in 1977 is a nice melancholy read. I think that's how you want to feel about reading about art.

I procrastinated writing about my app by making a site for my app.
