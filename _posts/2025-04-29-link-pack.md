I'd never heard Kylie Minogue's 1997 track, German Bold Italic, where she sings from the PoV of a font. But now I have, thanks to [Whitney Mallett's fantastic piece on the Dinamo blog](https://abcdinamo.com/news/german-bold-italic). I love it.

Los Campesinos' Gareth David Paisey talks about the music industry in a very open, accessible way. There's a bunch of details in here that I simply wasn't aware of, like many venues taking a 'merch cut.' [Los Campesinos - In The Black Stuff](https://loscampesinos.com/in-the-black-stuff/)

Sticking around in Britain, The Modern House is a real estate agency that has absolutely gorgeous photography of their listings. [This recent listing](https://themodernhouse.com/sales-list/north-farm-barn) is a great example of the type of houses they feature. I'm a sucker for a spiral staircase. 

Lots of people talking about the Harry Potter author the past few weeks. I missed hopping on the Harry Potter train as a child, but found [this zine comic to be an especially moving exploration of loving and falling out of love with art](https://redgoldsparkspress.com/projects/7180180). 

[A small archive of ads with great copywriting](https://nobodyreadsads.com/). 

[Our local bookstore is turning 50 years old](https://www.yourarlington.com/?view=article&id=22948:bookrack-042925&catid=111)! Earlier this year they started pulling up our account before we'd give our name. We did it. We're regulars. Some fun history in the article. Buy local!

[I just released my first app on the macOS store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oblique-pauses/id6744560234?mt=12)! I'll write more about it sometime soon, but it's meant to help you rest your eyes following the {% include sidenote.html text="20/20/20 rule" content="Every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds" %}. 

Bonus link. Los Campesinos' track [Feast of Tongues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgwEUnBmcE4) was one of my favorite songs from 2024. Hauntingly beautiful. Be safe out there this week.
