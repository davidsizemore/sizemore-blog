I walked my bike through Harvard Yard on my way to work today. I watched a student rub [John Harvard's](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/09/iconic-john-harvard-statue-is-the-star-of-the-yard/) foot on his way to class, and heard the bells peal. I was running late.

I was thinking about [this op-ed about Harvard](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/14/opinion/trump-higher-education.html), and how they should throw their doors open to more students. It's an interesting piece, but this part stuck with me. 

"So this is my radical proposal for universities: Act like universities, not like businesses. Spend your endowments. Accept more, not fewer students. Open up your campuses and expand your reach not by buying real estate but by bringing education to communities. Create a base. Become a movement."

Too many areas of our lives are trying to maximize profits.

## AI Jesus
Can I interest you in a video call with our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ? An {% include sidenote.html text="absolutely unhinged project" content="The menu is really something else." %} ostensibly about spiritial consumerism. "...Jesus is thinking..."

## Artist calling cards 
This gallery archive of calling cards from artists is visually pleasing as a grid and becomes an unexpectedly dense longform history lesson when you drill down into specific cards.

## Pop Shop
Keith Haring's artist card lead me on rabbit trail to learn more about his [Pop Shop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_Shop?useskin=vector). I didn't realize it ran up until 2005—I'm bummed I never saw it in person.

## Oners
So many amazing cinematic one-shots lately, from *Adolescence* (not for me) to Seth Rogan's fantastic *The Studio*. This video for BritBox speeds things up, by condensing a 14 hour shoot into a 90 second advert. Worth reading the ‘making of’ article, too.

## Kermit, a Typeface for Kids
I can't imagine many designers being enamored by how this typeface looks, but it's an extremely impressive example of design solving actual problems. A legible, expressive typeface based on findings from real studies specifically designed to help early learners read. The writeup is great with a ton of detail—check out the animation if you don't want to read. A perfect example of science, design, and technology working together.
