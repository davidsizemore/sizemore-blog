Hi. My name is David Sizemore, and I'd like to help you primary the incumbant Democrat you're running against. 

## Art director, designer, brand strategist 

I'm a designer with twenty years (oh dear) of experience working at the intersection of brand and technology. I've worked and lead teams at brand agencies making work for companies like Microsoft, CARE International, Boys & Girls Club, and McKesson, and I've helped grow and develop powerhouse teams at high performing tech companies. 

I've also maintained a healthy practice outside of my corporate career, working on personal art, design, brand, and digital projects for myself and my friends.

And now I want to work on your campaign.

## What can I do for you?

I've never worked on a political campaign before, and if you're reaching out to me, I imagine you haven't done this before either. So our idea of what we can accomplish together is going to shift and grow as we partner together. 

I'd like to help you develop a simple, cohesive, and reproducable graphic expression of who you are. You're going to be creating a lot of print collateral and digital material, and our goal would be to create expressive and flexible graphic elements that you and your team can use to communicate clearly and quickly with your community. If we do it right, these elements should feel like an authentic representation of who you are. 

What I'm not offering to do is be your full-time designer for the duration of your campaign. I would want to set you up with a template for posting engaging quotes on social media, but I would not be the one create social posts. I want to empower you and the people on your team with the tools you need to run a well branded campaign. And I think we can figure out what that means together. 

## Let's talk

If you're running on a progressive platform that aims to see government working FOR people (LGBTQ+ rights, reproductive rights, the right to organize, advancing racial justice and equity, and addressing climate change, to name a few), I'd love to talk with you and your team.
